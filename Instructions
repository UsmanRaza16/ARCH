Please follow the following instruction for using this protocol.
This code is for Network Simulator 2 (NS2) only.
The repository has three files named as ARCH.cc, ARCH.h and ns-default.tcl.
In order to use this protocol, certain changes are required in NS2.
In folder nsallinone-2.35/ns-2.35/queue/, replace the already existing red.cc and red.h files with ARCH.cc and ARCH.h.
In folder nsallinone-2.35/ns-2.35/tcl/lib/, replace the already existing ns-default.tcl file with the one provided here.
The purpose of replacing the header and tcl files is that some changes (new variables) have been made in these files required for ARCH technique.
After making the changes given above, complie your NS-2 by giving the make command from the command line. 
After the susscessful compliation, the ARCH is ready to use.
If the code does not execute, try renaming the files ARCH.cc to red.cc and ARCH.h to red.h (after deleting original red.cc and red.h in nsallinone-2.35/ns-2.35/queue/ directory) and then compile NS2. Your code must execute now.
